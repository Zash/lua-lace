_The Gitano Community_ is dedicated to providing a harassment-free experience
for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, sexual
orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, age, race, or
religion. We do not tolerate harassment of participants in any form.

This code of conduct applies to all _The Gitano Community_ spaces, including
our mailing lists such as `gitano-dev@gitano.org.uk`, our IRC channels such as
`#gitano` on Freenode, and at any in-person event at which members of the
community attend, both online and off. Anyone who violates this code of conduct
may be sanctioned or expelled from these spaces at the discretion of the Gitano
Community Managers.

Some _The Gitano Community_ spaces may have additional rules in place, which
will be made clearly available to participants. Participants are responsible
for knowing and abiding by these rules.

The full text of the code of conduct / contributor covenant / anti-harassment
policy can be found at: <https://www.gitano.org.uk/covenant/>.  Should the text
of that page differ from the content of this file then the newer content on the
website takes precedence.
