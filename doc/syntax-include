Syntax of include statements
----------------------------

Include statements take a source token to include and an optional list
of definitions which must all be true before the include will take
place.

'include' <sourcename> <0-or-more-definitions>

If the include ends with a question mark then should the sourcename
not be available at the time, it will be silently ignored.

Nominally an included ruleset is linearly inserted into the execution
stream there and then.  In practice, while include statements result
in compilation of the rulesets at the same time, the contents of the
ruleset will not be run unless the definitions all pass.  This means
that the defines will not happen unless the definitions all pass.  As
such, use conditional includes carefully.

If an "optional" include source isn't available, it is as though the
definitions did not pass.  If a mandatory include source isn't
available then compilation of the ruleset will fail immediately.
